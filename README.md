# About-me

https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet

I am a curious and enthusiastic full stack software developer with a passion for collaboration, innovation and continuous improvement. I enjoy building beautiful software that is intuitive and accessible, while solving real problems and presenting data in a digestible manner.

With a background in financial services in both the retail and investment spaces, I have now turned to my true passion of software development. I am looking for the perfect opportunity to grow as a developer, and utilise my past experiences to deliver amazing products.

As a fullstack developer, I use HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, React, REST APIs and Node.js, along with a constant focus on learning new languages and frameworks.

You can see all of this at work in my Github Repos. Some of these are personal projects, while some are team efforts. 

Below I've given a brief summary of the projects I've worked on, as well as some of my favourite code. 

Thank you for taking the time to have a look at my work, I hope you enjoy!
