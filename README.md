# About-me

I am a curious and enthusiastic full stack software developer with a passion for collaboration, innovation and continuous improvement. I enjoy building beautiful software that is intuitive and accessible, while solving real problems and presenting data in a digestible manner.

With a background in financial services in both the retail and investment spaces, I have now turned to my true passion of software development. I am looking for the perfect opportunity to grow as a developer, and utilise my past experiences to deliver amazing products.

As a fullstack developer, I use JavaScript, React, REST APIs, HTML5, CSS and Node.js, along with a constant focus on learning new languages and frameworks.

You can see all of this at work in my Github Repos. Some of these are personal projects, while some are team efforts. 

Thank you for taking the time to have a look at my work, I hope you enjoy!

## Projects

Most of the projects you can find on my github are short projects, hacked togeather over a period between 1-7 days. For the most part, these were team efforts and a lot of pair programming was involved in building the apps. 

### Tea Tree Tours
https://teatreetours.com.au/

A website for a small tourism operator. Built using JS, React, Bulma CSS, HTML, Node.js and express.js

Building this site from the ground up provided me with a fantastic opportunity to be a part of the full development cycle. From planning with the client, to SEO optimization and deployment on cPanel - there were many new challenges along the way. It was an incredible learning opportunity, and I'm very excited to have my first app deployed to the world

### GlassHome

Inspired by Glassdoor, [Glasshome](https://glasshome.herokuapp.com/#/) is a project hacked together over a week in a team of Seven. It is a fullstack web application that puts power in tenants hands by letting them have a voice.

For this project, I felt that it was vital for us to have the power to audit any reviews that are added to the site. For this reason, my main contribution to the project was to develop an Admin portal, where we could see metrics for recently added reviews, properties and users. Most importantly, I developed an Admin login using authenticare which gave us special permissions to update and delete any reviews or properties on the site.

Additionally, I also took charge of the styling for the site. Using the SCSS framework Bulma, I was able to explore a variety of ways to use SCSS to develop an application with UX in mind.
